Overcoming resistance in EGFR‑mutant lung cancer requires an integrated strategy that first dissects tumor evolution in exquisite detail—via longitudinal single‑cell and spatial multi‑omics, phospho‑proteomics, and deep ctDNA monitoring—to reveal on‑target mutations, bypass pathways, and micro‑environmental shifts; then models these dynamics in next‑generation platforms such as barcoded patient‑derived organoids, humanized lung‑on‑chip systems, and in vivo CRISPR screens to uncover actionable vulnerabilities; next, deploys tailored interventions ranging from fourth‑generation covalent or degradative EGFR inhibitors, bispecific antibodies and ADCs, to rational combination or sequential regimens that anticipate evolutionary trajectories; simultaneously targets epigenetic plasticity, non‑coding RNA networks, and immuno‑stromal crosstalk to blunt phenotype switching and micro‑environment‑driven escape; and finally ties the entire effort together with real‑time data infrastructure and AI reasoning tools that transform granular patient data into adaptive trial designs and early‑stage preventative strategies, collectively creating a feedback loop that predicts, intercepts, and ultimately prevents therapeutic resistance.
