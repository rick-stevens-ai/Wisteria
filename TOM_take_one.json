      "title": "Temporal Crosstalk between Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling and Emergence of Off-target Resistance Mutations Drives Heterogeneity in Osimertinib Resistance",
      "description": "This hypothesis posits that, in EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with osimertinib, dynamic shifts in the tumor microenvironment (TME)—specifically, the influx and activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—create localized niches that selectively promote the survival and clonal expansion of cancer cells harboring off-target resistance mutations (such as MET, HER2, or KRAS alterations). The hypothesis further predicts that these TME-driven niches are spatially and temporally associated with increased regional heterogeneity and the emergence of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation zones post-TKI failure, as detected by spatial transcriptomics and phospho-proteomics. The key mechanism suggested is that paracrine signaling from stromal and immune cells activates bypass signaling pathways and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs, which in turn provide a survival advantage to off-target resistant clones and facilitate phenotypic plasticity.",
      "experimental_validation": "To validate this hypothesis, paired pre- and post-progression core biopsies from EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib will be subjected to: (1) single-cell multi-omics (scDNA+scRNA+CITE-seq) to map the co-evolution of on- and off-target resistance clones; (2) spatial transcriptomics (using Slide-seq-v3 or NanoString CosMx) to identify regional microenvironmental changes and SCLC transformation zones; (3) phospho-proteomic profiling to detect activation of bypass tracks. These data will be integrated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CAF, MDSC, EMT, and SCLC markers. Controls will include biopsies from treatment-naive and stable disease cases. Longitudinal plasma ctDNA and cytokine profiling will provide systemic correlates. In PDO and lung-on-chip models, CAFs and MDSCs will be added or depleted to test their effect on resistance clone emergence under osimertinib. Expected outcomes: (a) regions of microenvironmental remodeling correlate with local expansion of off-target resistant clones; (b) experimental depletion of CAFs/MDSCs reduces emergence of off-target resistance in preclinical models.",
      "theory_and_computation": "An agent-based spatial model will be constructed to simulate tumor evolution under TKI pressure, incorporating microenvironmental cell types, paracrine signaling, and mutation acquisition. Machine learning algorithms (e.g., graph convolutional networks) will integrate multi-modal omics and spatial data to predict the emergence and location of resistance clones. Mathematical modeling of clonal dynamics in varying microenvironmental contexts will yield quantitative predictions that can be tested against single-cell lineage tracing data.",

      "description": "This hypothesis posits that a small subset of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with high baseline chromatin accessibility and expression of plasticity-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exist prior to osimertinib therapy. These subclones are poised for phenotypic transition, and their proportion and spatial localization in pre-treatment biopsies predict the likelihood and timing of histologic transformation to SCLC upon TKI resistance. The hypothesis suggests that single-cell multi-omic and spatial transcriptomic profiling will reveal early, regionally clustered, epigenetically plastic clones expressing markers such as SOX2, ASCL1, and select lncRNAs. These clones will expand and dominate the tumor architecture upon osimertinib-induced selective pressure, preceding detectable SCLC transformation and associated with specific microenvironmental cues.",

Integrate lineage tracing via CRISPR barcoding if possible. 4. Correlate the abundance and spatial patterning of plastic subclones in pre-treatment samples with the timing and extent of SCLC transformation (confirmed by IHC for EGFR, TP53, RB1, and neuroendocrine markers) at progression. 5. Validate functional plasticity by isolating plastic and non-plastic subclones from patient-derived organoids, exposing them to osimertinib, and monitoring for phenotypic switching in vitro. Controls: Non-plastic subclones, non-EGFR mutant samples, and matched normal tissue. Measurements: Single-cell chromatin accessibility, lncRNA and plasticity marker expression, spatial mapping, timing to transformation. Expected outcomes: Pre-existing, spatially clustered, epigenetically plastic subclones predict early SCLC transformation under therapy.",

      "description": "This hypothesis posits that, during osimertinib therapy, a subset of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells undergoes reversible, cyclical transitions between distinct epigenetic states—particularly involving histone methylation and acetylation—that are temporally synchronized with dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as cytokine flux and stromal cell infiltration. These transient epigenetic states, including partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem-like phenotypes, confer drug tolerance and foster the emergence of persister clones. The process is hypothesized to be spatially heterogeneous, with specific tumor regions (e.g., perivascular niches or CAF-rich areas) acting as reservoirs for these persister populations. The transitions are predicted to be detectable by single-cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics, manifest as oscillatory patterns in chromatin accessibility, enhancer activity, and non-coding RNA expression, and precede the outgrowth of genetically resistant clones.",

Single-cell multi-omics (10x Genomics scATAC-seq + scRNA-seq + CITE-seq) will be performed on dissociated tumor cells, integrated with spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq v3 or NanoString CosMx) on core biopsies to map epigenetic state transitions and their spatial context. Key chromatin modifiers (e.g., LSD1, EZH2) and EMT/stemness markers will be assessed by immunohistochemistry and phospho-proteomics. Temporal dynamics of these states will be correlated with TME features (CAF, TAM, cytokines) quantified by multiplex imaging and single-cell proteomics. Functional validation will be performed in patient-derived organoids (PDOs) barcoded and subjected to serial drug escalation, with and without epigenetic inhibitors, and in microfluidic lung-on-chip models incorporating autologous stroma. The emergence, disappearance, and cycling of drug-tolerant states will be tracked in real time. Controls include untreated baseline samples, normal lung tissue, and mock-treated PDOs. Expected outcomes: (1) identification of cyclical, reversible chromatin and transcriptomic changes in persister cells; (2) spatial co-localization with specific TME features; (3) abrogation of persister emergence by transient epigenetic reprogramming.",
      "theory_and_computation": "A mathematical model consisting of a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and stochastic simulations will be developed to describe the cycling between epigenetic states, incorporating TME-driven signaling as dynamic external inputs. Agent-based spatial simulations will model clonal evolution within a virtual tumor, integrating chromatin state transitions, microenvironmental cues, and drug exposure. Machine learning algorithms (e.g., hidden Markov models, trajectory inference) will be applied to longitudinal single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data to infer state transitions and predict future clonal fates. Bayesian network analyses will link epigenetic states with TME features and resistance outcomes.

The key prediction is that intermittent suppression of epigenetic plasticity disrupts the adaptive state-switching that enables tumor cells to survive and subsequently propagate under continued TKI pressure.

Specifically, as osimertinib selects for resistant EGFR clones (e.g., C797S, MET amplification), these clones secrete factors that recruit and polarize TAMs towards an M2-like, pro-tumoral phenotype. In turn, these TAMs secrete cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TGF-β) that induce epigenetic modifications—such as H3K27me3 and DNA methylation—within tumor subclones, promoting EMT, drug tolerance, and even SCLC transformation.

It predicts that these cytokine-rich microdomains co-localize with areas of RB1/TP53 loss and unique transcriptomic signatures, creating a permissive niche for histologic transdifferentiation. As a result, the emergence of SCLC histology will not be uniform, but instead will be spatially restricted to regions where combined genetic loss and microenvironmental cues converge. Mechanistically, the hypothesis suggests that stromal and immune cell-derived cytokines interact with pre-existing genetic lesions to reprogram epithelial tumor cells, and that these transformations can be mapped and predicted by integrating spatial transcriptomics, cytokine profiling, and digital pathology.",

Specifically, the hypothesis predicts that specific enhancer/promoter methylation and histone modification signatures in TAMs (e.g., H3K27ac, H3K4me1 at immune-suppressive gene loci) arise 2–4 weeks before the expansion of both on-target (e.g., C797S) and off-target (e.g., MET, KRAS) resistant cancer cell clones. These reprogrammed TAMs exhibit upregulated cytokine and checkpoint ligand expression, fostering a local environment permissive to resistance clone selection and outgrowth.
