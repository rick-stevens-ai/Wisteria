      "description": "This hypothesis posits that exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDR) within a specific 'adaptive window' triggers the production of specific non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which in turn mediate long-lasting chromatin remodeling and epigenetic memory in somatic cells. This remodeling primes DNA repair, antioxidant, and cell survival pathways for future stress, enhancing cellular resilience to subsequent genotoxic insults. Key predictions include: (1) a defined temporal window post-LDR in which cells exhibit enhanced adaptive responses to secondary stressors; (2) identification of unique LDR-induced ncRNA profiles that are necessary and sufficient for chromatin state alterations; and (3) that blocking these ncRNAs abrogates the adaptive phenotype.",
      "experimental_validation": "To validate this hypothesis, primary human fibroblasts and epithelial cell lines will be exposed to LDR (e.g., 0.05 Gy X-rays). Time-course RNA-seq will identify LDR-induced ncRNAs. ChIP-seq for histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K9me3) will assess chromatin changes. Cells will be challenged with a secondary genotoxic insult (e.g., H2O2 or higher-dose radiation) at various post-LDR time points. Adaptive responses will be measured via DNA damage assays (γ-H2AX foci), cell survival, and gene expression profiles. Antisense oligonucleotides or CRISPRi will be used to knock down candidate ncRNAs to test necessity. Controls include sham-irradiated and high-dose-irradiated cells. Expected outcomes: elevated resilience in the adaptive window, loss of adaptation with ncRNA inhibition.",

Stochastic simulations will predict the dynamics of epigenetic memory formation and loss, and identify critical ncRNA nodes. Machine learning (e.g., random forest classifiers) will be used to predict adaptive phenotype based on ncRNA and chromatin signatures. Mathematical modeling will establish the quantitative 'window' parameters of adaptation and decay.",

The key prediction is that LDR triggers the methylation of loci involved in DNA repair, oxidative stress response, and apoptosis, thereby enhancing genomic stability and cellular resilience. The mechanism is hypothesized to involve LDR-induced activation of DNA methyltransferases and chromatin remodelers, leading to a unique methylation 'signature' that persists for multiple cell generations.",
      "experimental_validation": "Experimentally, isolated mouse intestinal and hematopoietic stem cells would be exposed in vitro to LDR (20, 50, 100 mGy) and compared to sham-irradiated controls. DNA methylation profiling (e.g., bisulfite-seq, methylation arrays) would be performed at multiple time points (immediately, 1 week, 1 month post-exposure). The persistence and functional consequences of methylation changes would be assessed using RNA-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq for DNMTs and histone marks), and single-cell assays. Functional assays include challenging cells with high-dose radiation or genotoxins and measuring DNA damage (γ-H2AX foci), apoptosis, and clonogenic survival. Methylation-blocking agents (e.g., 5-azacytidine) would be used as controls. Key expected outcomes: LDR-exposed cells display unique, persistent methylation signatures correlating with enhanced genomic stability and survival, reversible by methylation inhibition.",

      "description": "This hypothesis posits that exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDR) induces specific, persistent epigenetic modifications—particularly in chromatin structure—that prime cells for enhanced adaptive responses to subsequent stressors. The proposed mechanism involves LDR-induced deposition or removal of specific histone marks (e.g., H3K9me3, H3K27ac) at genomic loci associated with DNA repair, antioxidant defense, and apoptosis regulation. These chromatin changes do not directly activate stress-response genes but sensitize them for rapid and robust transcriptional upregulation upon subsequent exposure to higher radiation doses or other cellular stresses. Key predictions include: (1) LDR induces distinct, persistent histone modification profiles compared to high-dose exposure; (2) these profiles correlate with faster gene activation kinetics upon secondary stress; and (3) pharmacological or genetic disruption of the relevant chromatin modifiers abrogates the adaptive response.",
      "experimental_validation": "To test this hypothesis, primary human fibroblasts or hematopoietic stem cells will be exposed to low-dose (e.g., 0.05 Gy) X-rays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) will be performed for key histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me3) at multiple post-exposure time points (1 h, 24 h, 7 days).

Controls will include sham-irradiated cells, high-dose-only cells, and cells treated with inhibitors of histone methyltransferases or acetyltransferases. Measurements will include gene expression kinetics, DNA damage foci resolution, and cell survival rates. Expected outcomes: LDR-primed cells show persistent chromatin changes and a faster/more robust transcriptional response to secondary stress, which is lost upon chromatin modifier inhibition.",

Computational simulations will model chromatin accessibility dynamics and gene activation probability as a function of histone mark distribution post-LDR. Bayesian inference models can be employed to identify causal relationships between specific chromatin states and adaptive gene expression patterns.

Specifically, LDIR triggers transient, tissue-specific changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA expression that activate pro-survival and DNA repair pathways, ultimately enhancing organismal resilience to subsequent stressors. The hormetic effect is predicted to be mediated via intercellular signaling involving extracellular vesicles (EVs) that carry epigenetic modulators from irradiated to non-irradiated cells, thus orchestrating a coordinated systemic response.",

Additional groups will receive serum or isolated EVs from LDIR-exposed animals to non-irradiated recipients to test for transfer of the hormetic response. Functional assays (e.g., colony-forming unit assays for stem cells, stress survival assays) will assess enhanced resilience. Expected outcomes include tissue-specific, transient epigenetic changes, increased DNA repair gene expression, and transmission of resilience via EVs.",

This signaling leads to specific, heritable changes in chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation patterns in newly generated lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Key predictions are: (1) LDIR-exposed animals will show enhanced immune responses to novel antigens; (2) HSPCs from LDIR-exposed animals will display persistent epigenetic marks associated with heightened immunocompetence; (3) Blocking DAMP signaling will abrogate these effects.",

      "description": "This hypothesis posits that exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDR; ≤0.1 Gy) triggers a transient, adaptive metabolic reprogramming in mammalian somatic cells. Specifically, LDR enhances flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased NADPH production and improved redox homeostasis. This metabolic shift augments the cell's ability to withstand subsequent oxidative or genotoxic insults, conferring a window of heightened stress resistance that is reversible and distinct from chronic adaptive responses seen at higher doses. The hypothesis predicts that this reprogramming is orchestrated by rapid, radiation-induced activation of metabolic sensors such as AMPK and Nrf2.",

Metabolic flux will be quantified using 13C-glucose and 13C-glutamine tracing, combined with LC-MS/MS metabolomics at multiple time points (0–48 hours post-irradiation). Key readouts: NADPH/NADP+ ratios, PPP intermediates, oxygen consumption rate (Seahorse assay), and transcript/protein levels of AMPK, Nrf2, and their downstream targets. Functional assays will assess resistance to secondary oxidative (H2O2) or genotoxic (higher radiation, cisplatin) insults delivered 6–24 hours post-LDR. Controls: sham-irradiated cells, high-dose (≥1 Gy) irradiated cells, and pharmacological inhibition of AMPK/Nrf2. Expected outcomes: (1) transient metabolic reprogramming after LDR, (2) increased NADPH and decreased ROS, (3) enhanced survival after secondary insult, abrogated by sensor inhibition.",

Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models will simulate flux changes in central carbon metabolism and antioxidant pathways following LDR, incorporating regulatory nodes for AMPK and Nrf2.

Crucially, this mechanism leads to systemic enhancement of DNA repair, oxidative stress resistance, and immune modulation in tissues not directly exposed to radiation, representing a form of bystander hormesis. Key predictions include: (1) exosomes from LDIR-exposed cells confer increased resistance to subsequent genotoxic stress in naïve recipient cells; (2) removal or inhibition of exosome release abolishes the systemic protective effect; (3) exosomal cargoes are distinct from those generated by high-dose radiation or sham control.",

Rather than merely causing stochastic DNA damage, low dose radiation initiates a specific cascade of chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation changes, and non-coding RNA expression that upregulates DNA repair, antioxidant defense, and anti-apoptotic pathways. The prediction is that specific patterns of histone modifications and DNA methylation will emerge post-exposure and correlate with increased cell survival and reduced genomic instability after a secondary, higher dose challenge. This epigenetic priming is hypothesized to be transient, dose-dependent, and distinct from responses to high-dose radiation.",

Subsequently, both pre-exposed and control cells will be challenged with a higher dose (2 Gy), and endpoints such as cell survival (clonogenic assay), DNA damage (γ-H2AX foci), and micronucleus formation will be measured. Epigenetic changes will be correlated with functional resistance to damage. Pharmacological inhibition of key epigenetic modifiers (DNMTs, HDACs) will be used to test causality.

Specifically, LDIR selectively hypomethylates promoters of genes involved in oxidative stress response and DNA repair, upregulating these pathways. These epigenetic modifications persist through multiple cell divisions and can be transmitted to daughter cells, conferring enhanced resistance not only to radiation but also to other forms of cellular stress. The key prediction is that LDIR-exposed cells and their descendants will exhibit a distinct methylation and gene expression profile, alongside increased resilience to DNA damage, even after several generations in the absence of further radiation.",

LDR is proposed to increase flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and activate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased NADPH production and improved redox homeostasis. In addition, recent evidence suggests that radiation-induced metabolic reprogramming may also engage autophagic pathways, particularly in cells with specific genetic or metabolic backgrounds (e.g., IDH1 mutations in gliomas), shifting energy production toward autophagy under conditions of compromised mitochondrial function. This dual metabolic and autophagic adaptation augments resistance to subsequent oxidative or genotoxic insults, conferring a reversible window of heightened stress resistance. The reprogramming is orchestrated by rapid, radiation-induced activation of metabolic sensors such as AMPK and Nrf2, and may be modulated by cellular context, including oncogenic mutations that alter baseline metabolism and stress responses.",

Quantify PPP flux, NADPH/NADP+ ratios, and oxidative phosphorylation activity in mammalian cells following LDR exposure using metabolic flux analysis and respirometry. 2. Measure autophagic flux (LC3II/I ratio, p62 degradation, autophagosome formation) post-LDR in both wild-type and genetically modified cells (e.g., IDH1 mutant glioma cells). 3. Assess the contribution of autophagy to stress resistance by pharmacologically or genetically inhibiting key autophagy regulators (e.g., Atg7) and evaluating cellular survival after LDR and subsequent oxidative/genotoxic challenge. 4. Use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to monitor expression and chromatin changes in metabolic and autophagy-related genes post-LDR. 5. Employ in vivo tumor models with controlled LDR and targeted autophagy inhibition to assess effects on tumor response and survival.",

Develop computational models that integrate metabolic network fluxes (including PPP, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation) and autophagic flux under LDR conditions. 2. Use gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses on transcriptomic and epigenomic data to map LDR-induced reprogramming. 3. Simulate cellular responses to LDR in different genetic backgrounds (e.g., wild-type vs. IDH1-mutant) to predict context-dependent shifts between mitochondrial metabolism and autophagy. 4. Apply machine learning to multi-omics datasets to identify markers of stress resistance and to predict therapeutic responses to combined LDR and autophagy modulation.",
