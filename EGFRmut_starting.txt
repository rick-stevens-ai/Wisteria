1	Longitudinal single‑cell multi‑omics of paired pre‑/post‑progression biopsies and plasma	Captures co‑evolving on‑target (e.g., C797S) and off‑target (e.g., MET, HER2, KRAS) resistance clones plus microenvironment shifts at single‑cell resolution.	Combine 10x Genomics scDNA+scRNA with CITE‑seq and ultra‑deep ctDNA every 6 weeks during osimertinib; integrate with lineage‑tracing to reconstruct clonal trees.
2	Spatial transcriptomics on transmural core biopsies	Detects regional heterogeneity and small‑cell lung cancer (SCLC) histologic transformation zones after 3rd‑generation TKI failure  ￼	Apply Slide‑seq‑v3 or NanoString CosMx; co‑register EGFR/TP53/RB1 IHC to link spatial gene programs with morphologic change.
3	High‑throughput phospho‑proteomic atlas of resistant biopsies	Many bypass tracks activate at the signaling‑protein level rather than mutation.	Use mass‑spec–based phospho‑tyrosine enrichment and kinase‑substrate inference; map druggable nodes.
B. Advanced pre‑clinical platforms			
4	Patient‑derived organoid (PDO) “biobank + barcoding”	Maintains intra‑tumor heterogeneity lost in 2‑D cell lines; barcoding tracks subclonal dynamics under drug pressure.	Establish 100 EGFR mut⁺ PDOs (ex19del, L858R, uncommon mutants); CRISPR‑barcode and expose to serial drug escalation & combinations.
5	Humanized microfluidic “lung‑on‑chip” with autologous immune & stromal compartments	Models how cancer‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and myeloid cells blunt TKI response.	Seed chip with matched patient PDO, CAFs, TAMs; quantify permeability, EMT markers, cytokines during therapy.
6	In vivo CRISPR‑dropout screens in orthotopic PDXs	Identifies synthetic‑lethal partners of osimertinib in a physiologic lung environment.	Deliver genome‑wide CRISPR libraries via AAV; monitor sgRNA depletion in treated vs. control mice.

7	Fourth‑generation covalent allosteric TKIs (e.g., JIN‑A02) + brain‑penetrant design	Show early activity against C797S & L718Q resistance mutations  ￼ ￼	Fund medicinal‑chem refinement for CSF exposure; launch adaptive phase Ib for patients progressing in CNS.
8	EGFR/MET bispecific or biparatopic antibodies + antibody‑drug conjugates (ADCs)	Amivantamab and telisotuzumab‑vedotin combinations prolong PFS after TKI failure  ￼ ￼	Explore tri‑specific EGFR/MET/AXL format to pre‑empt emergent bypass nodes.
9	Proteolysis‑Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) that degrade mutant EGFR	Eliminates both kinase‑dependent and scaffold functions; may avoid gatekeeper resistance.	Use cereblon‑recruiting PROTACs selective for ex19del/L858R and C797S; test in resistant PDOs.
10	Small‑molecule “molecular glues” to re‑sensitize C797S EGFR to osimertinib	Forces misfolding or abnormal dimerization that restores drug binding.	Screen covalent fragments by NanoBRET in cells expressing mutant EGFR.
D. Combination & sequencing strategies			
11	Rational upfront triplets: EGFR‑TKI + VEGF/angiopoietin blocker + CDK4/6 inhibitor	Simultaneously tackles micro‑environmental survival signals and cell‑cycle escape; afatinib‑bevacizumab post‑progression shows promise  ￼	Launch window‑of‑opportunity trial with serial biopsies to test pathway shutdown.
12	“On‑demand” MET or HER3 ADC add‑on triggered by rising plasma ctDNA	Uses minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring to intercept bypass pathways early.	Validate 2‑log ctDNA rise as trigger; prospective study adding telisotuzumab‑vedotin or patritumab‑deruxtecan at MRD.
13	Sequential TKI rotation guided by deep mutational learning	AI model predicts evolutionary trajectories under each TKI; schedule drugs to steer toward fitness dead‑ends.	Train on >3,000 serial ctDNA datasets; simulate in barcoded PDOs.

14	LncRNA or circRNA nanoparticle therapeutics	Specific ncRNAs propagate osimertinib resistance  ￼; silencing could re‑sensitize tumors.	Use lipid nanoparticles delivering GapmeRs against validated lncRNA panel; test in PDXs.
15	Epigenetic “re‑programming” with LSD1 or EZH2 degraders during drug holiday	Blocks epigenetic plasticity that enables phenotype switching (EMT, SCLC transformation).	3‑day pulse of degrader between TKI cycles in PDOs; track morphological state with live imaging.
F. Exploiting immune & stromal interplay			
16	Engineered NK‑cell engager targeting EGFRvIII‑like neoepitopes arising in resistant clones	Avoids T‑cell exhaustion seen in prior EGFR CAR‑T efforts; can be combined with TKIs.	Develop CD16a x neo‑EGFR engager; assess cytotoxicity against osimertinib‑resistant cells.
17	Re‑educating tumor‑associated macrophages (TAMs) with CD47/SIRPα blockade + TKI	TAMs promote EMT and drug tolerance; CD47 blockade may synergize with TKIs.	Orthotopic PDX trial of CD47 antibody + osimertinib; monitor macrophage polarization by CyTOF.

18	Real‑time “Resistance Map” registry integrating imaging, ctDNA, and treatment history	Accelerates hypothesis generation and adaptive trials.	Deploy REDCap‑based platform across DOE‑affiliated centers; auto‑populate from EHR and radiomics pipelines.
19	Large‑language‑model–powered literature & trial recommender (“Aurora‑EGFR”)	Rapidly surfaces mechanistic links and novel combos from 100k+ papers; prioritizes for bench validation.	Fine‑tune on curated EGFR corpus; dock to Slack for weekly hypothesis drops.
H. Early‑stage prevention of resistance			
20	Adjuvant osimer ± Rybrevant/Lazertinib regimen in early‑stage resected disease	FDA recently approved Rybrevant + Lazertinib as chemotherapy‑free first‑line therapy  ￼; studying adjuvant setting could eradicate resistant clones before they emerge.	Design phase II randomizing osimertinib vs. triplet in stage IB‑IIIA EGFR mut⁺ patients, with serial MRD data.
